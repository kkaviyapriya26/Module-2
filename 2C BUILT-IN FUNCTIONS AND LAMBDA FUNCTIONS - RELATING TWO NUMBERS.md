## BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS AND LAMBDA FUNCTIONS - RELATING TWO NUMBERS

---

### AIM  
To write a Python program to check the relation between two numbers — whether one number is greater than, equal to, or lesser than another — using a lambda function.

---

### ALGORITHM

1. Begin the program.  
2. Use `eval()` to get two numbers (`num1` and `num2`) from the user.  
3. Define a lambda function `max` that takes two arguments `x` and `y`.  
4. The lambda function compares the numbers and prints:
   - If `x > y`, then it prints: "`num2` is smaller than `num1`".
   - Otherwise, it prints: "`num1` is smaller than `num2`".
5. Call the lambda function by passing `num1` and `num2` as arguments.  
6. Terminate the program.

### PROGRAM

```
REG NO 212223060120
NAME KAVIYA PRIYA K
# Define the lambda function
multiply_by_45 = lambda z: z * 45

# Example usage
result = multiply_by_45(int(input()))  # Example input
print(result)  # Output will be 450
```

### RESULT
Thus lambda function which takes z as a parameter and returns z*45 using python is implemented and successfully verified
